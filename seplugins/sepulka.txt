#if you want to disable something, change "on" to "off"

#Last played homebrew/iso will be displayed on first place in XMB
autosort on
#Ex: autosort off - sorting will be disabled

#If you really like to use bootscreen type "bootscreen on"
bootscreen off
#bootscreen on
#It's disabled by default because it doesn't look cool

#An alternative to bootscreen. All steps done by sepulka are reported to log.txt on root of ms0:
filelog off
#filelog on
#It's disabled by default because it isn't very useful in usual game playing.

#Plugins and game titles/id:          #
#Tip: if you want to disable something, add '#' sign at the line beginning
#
#Syntax:
# - first goes FULL path to your plugin (w/o spaces), followed by space and parameters divorced by '|' sign
# - parameters are:
#   - games' IDs
#   - games' titles (only latin)
#   - macro (see "macros.txt")
#   - path to your game, it can be incomplete and it can contain spaces.
# - if you add '~' sign before parameter, it won't load plugin for this game
# - if you add '(mode)' before parameter (but after '~' sign) it will work for that game only in specified mode
# - modes are: UMD - disc games; ISO - all backups (cso and iso); PBP - homebrew and PSS games
# - modes can be stand-alone
# - comment: start line by '#'

#Always load RemoteJoyLite, excluding disc version of GoW:CoO

#Load m33_620.prx to add PSP-450 support only for Invizimals and Go!Fall
ms0:/seplugins/m33_620.prx       InviZimals | Go!Fall

#Always load that plugin:
ms0:/seplugins/always.prx        ISO | UMD | PBP

#Loads plugin only for UMD version of M:AE
ms0:/seplugins/stargate.prx      (UMD)Motorstorm: Arctic Edge

#Loads plugin for games defined by the path
ms0:/seplugins/plugin.prx        ms0:/ISO/my_backup.iso
#Now paths can be used like normal parameter!
